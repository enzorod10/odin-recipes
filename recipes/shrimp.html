        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; cook linguine in
                boiling water until nearly tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large 
                skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir shallots, garlic, and red 
                pepper flakes in the hot butter and oil until shallots are translucent,
                3 to 4 minutes. Season shrimp with kosher salt and black pepper; add to
                the skillet and cook until pink, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes.
                Remove shrimp from skillet and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Pour white wine and lemon juice into skillet and bring to a boil 
                while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the 
                skillet with a wooden spoon. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet,
                stir 2 tablespoons olive oil into butter mixture, and bring to a
                simmer. Toss linguine, shrimp, and parsley in the butter mixture
                until coated; season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle with 1 
                teaspoon olive oil to serve.</li>
