        <h3>Description</h3>
        There are certain things that if I see on a menu, I will almost 
        always order them, and brandade is one of those things. This amazing
        dish from the south of France can be made many different ways, 
        but it's usually some sort of combination of salt cod, potato, garlic,
        and olive oil. This should always be baked and eaten piping hot, 
        ideally with some homemade crostini. 
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound salted cod fish</li>
            <li>1.5 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>5 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly 
                grease a baking dish and set dish on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Rinse salt cod under cold water, transfer to a sealable 
                container and cover with several inches of cold water. Soak
                cod in the refrigerator, changing the water every few hours,
                for 24 to 36 hours. Remove cod from water and cut into 
                evenly-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Stir cod, milk, thyme, bay leaves, and cayenne pepper together
                 in a pot over medium-high heat. Cook until fish begins to
                 flake; 7 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and strain; reserve 
                 cooking liquid and transfer fish to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Place potatoes and garlic in a large pot and cover with water;
                bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until
                tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Mash cod, a few splashes reserved cooking liquid, and lemon
                zest together in a bowl. Pour in remaining reserved cooking
                liquid and potatoes; mash until desired consistency is 
                reached. Stir in 1/2 of the olive oil, lemon juice, and black 
                pepper until smooth. Add remaining olive oil and blend until 
                smooth. Season with salt. Pour mixture into prepared baking
                dish. Spread creme fraiche over the top and score the top with 
                a spoon to create a crisscross surface.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbling, about 
                20 minutes</li>
        </ol>
